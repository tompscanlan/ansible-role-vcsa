# ansible-role-vcsa

Deploys a VMware Platform Service Controller or vCenter Server Appliance (vcsa) using
the ovftool or the cli installer in vcsa 6.5.

# Requirements

This role requires the following (Pip) modules.

- molecule
- pyVmomi
- pysphere

To install the vcsa, you must have downloaded the vcsa ISO from vmware before hand.
This ISO contains the ova we will deploy to ESXi or vCenter Server Instance.

# Role Variables

This role is under heavy development, thus the variables may change often.
At present, the following variables are setup via defaults/main.yml, or are
otherwise required.

Note: A non-defaulted variable, download_site, must be set by a vars file
or by other mechanism prior to calling this role. The download_site must
provide a URL base (e.g., http://mysite.com/downloads)
from which the download files (e.g., ISO files or similar) may be obtained.
See the defaults/main.yml for the files of interest.
